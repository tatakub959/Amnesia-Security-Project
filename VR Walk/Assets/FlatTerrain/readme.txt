Flat Terrain 2016 

// GET STARTED //////////////////////////////////////////////

- Attach the 'FlatTerrain' script to your Terrain game object
- Click the wheel icon in the terrain inspector and lower the "Heightmap Resolution" to get a nice low poly count for your terrain (I suggest 33 for a 500x500 terrain)
- Set "Pixel Error" to your preference (I suggest 1)
- Adjust "Base Map Dist." to your preference
- Use the built in unity terrain tools as normal, the FlatTerrain script should work seamlessly with them
- Adjust Rim lighting and texture blending to your tastes.
